## About this project
This is a visualization of A* (Pathfinding algorithm) and Bresensham's Line Algorithm (Line of sight/raycast) set in a simple 2D game.  
Source code for algorithms can be found in [enemy.js](https://github.com/Nademtis/DSA-ML-exam/blob/main/Enemy.js) look for aStar() & calculateLineOfSight()
